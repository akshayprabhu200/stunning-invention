Welcome to my about page! My name is Akshay, and I am currently a Master of Science in Computer Science student at the University of California, San Diego. I am passionate about frontend and full stack development. I have experience working as a React developer, building and maintaining web applications using the React framework and TypeScript. I have a good understanding of the principles of React, including its component-based architecture, and have experience using related technologies such as Redux and React Router. I am well-versed in modern JavaScript and TypeScript, and have experience working with popular libraries and tools such as Node.js, Webpack, and Babel. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills in the field of computer science. On my free time, you can find me experimenting with new frameworks and libraries or working on personal projects. Thank you for visiting my page and please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or opportunities.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
